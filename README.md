## Description

As a student learning how to code, note taking can take a bit to get used to; organizing those notes can get even more difficult\n-Not knowing where to save the notes\n-Having to dig through multiple dense note files just to find answers\nSO i created a note taker that can organise your notes by a title and be stored in a databse all in one place\n Throughout this process i learned the intricacies of connecting a db to a public file and working between a front end and a back end
