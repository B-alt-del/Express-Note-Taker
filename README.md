## Description

As a student learning how to code, note taking can take a bit to get used to; organizing those notes can get even more difficult
-Not knowing where to save the notes
-Having to dig through multiple dense note files just to find answers

SO i created a note taker that can organise your notes with a title and be stored in a databse all in one place

Throughout this process i learned the intricacies of connecting a db to a public file and working between a front end and a back end
